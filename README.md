My startup application will be the game of Dots and Dashes! Everyone loves to sit in church and connect those little dots and to crush your opponent into the dust, but setting up each and every dot and drawing every line is so taxing. Not to mention you can only play with someone sitting right next to you. Enter, Dots and Dashes, the fast paced web application that allows for speedy play and game reset, with live opponent chat included. Save your win/loss ratio in your account, and even leave a game half finished and come back to keep the action going.

Use modifier 'Sudo' to access write protected files



There were a lot of things I learned from the simon project. First of all, incredible (again) that such functionality comes from so little code, incredible that we have that capability. Additionally, I learned how simple it is to link pages together. Probably because that's what HTML is made to do, but hey, I still think it's cool. We see websites often as these abstract untouchable things that have no substance, when they're really just simple files hooked together in a simple way. Incredible.


From the Simon CSS activity I learned a cool thing about border-radius. I was curious how you go about getting those shapes made, and it turns out you can change the roundness of a button with CSS! Verry cool


OH MY HOLY FREAKING CRAP, I THINK I LOVE THIS CLASS. I learned so much from the HTML CSS startup deliverable project, particularly a problem I dealt with and overcame often was how to center a div and it's contents on the page. I finally found margin: auto; and that was a lifsaver. So many more things, how to overlap elements by using aboslute and relative positioning, using hover, onclick and other operations, and how to use CSS effectively to affect multiple instances of an element rather than using style ="" for each. very tedious hour I spent before I got wise.

I'm soo excited to apply this next info to my website. Basically to store info, you just do it. You literally make up a variable name and pass the data. Crazy stuff


Oh my gosh, there are mountains I learned from doing the start up javascript project. I learned how to access any element from any element, to use colors, switch statements, dynamically change info based on clicks, store info in a browser, the list is endless! Way cool
