My startup application will be the game of Dots and Dashes! Everyone loves to sit in church and connect those little dots and to crush your opponent into the dust, but setting up each and every dot and drawing every line is so taxing. Not to mention you can only play with someone sitting right next to you. Enter, Dots and Dashes, the fast paced web application that allows for speedy play and game reset, with live opponent chat included. Save your win/loss ratio in your account, and even leave a game half finished and come back to keep the action going.
